My great grand father was a marginal farmer had just passed away. Leaving my great grandmother, a young widow with 2 sons and no source of income. To provide for his sons. And the future, she had to move to a town nearby. And make some difficult choices. She became a domestic servant, but still could only afford to send one of her sons to school. While the 2 boys were close in age. Both in grade school. One was seen as being more responsible. While the other was a bit of a troublemaker. My great grandmother, Aapta to send the more responsible diligence on viewed as having more potential. Into the workforce. He became a day laborer at a construction site. He would continue in that field for the rest of his life never given the opportunity to gain new skills. Engaine high level employment. The other son was sent to the local school. And that boy was my grand father. Despite being seen as being less responsible. He continued through school and eventually became a police officer. Despite entering the workforce nearly a decade after his brother. His starting salary was exponentially higher. It was my grandfathers education and eventual carrier that enabled my father to pursue his own education. Which eventually allowed me? To follow my own passions. The opportunity my grand father was given impacted the tragic trajectory's. Of the generations to come. This personal story reflects. That often repeated Adeje. Talent is everywhere, but opportunity is not. Today's event is about education and technology. More specifically, it is about empowering the students of today to create the world of tomorrow. Whenever is an amazing time of technological progress. Every aspect of our lives economies in societies of being shaped. My digital technologies. How about technology is also creating disruption? There's a growing concern over job growth economic opportunity. And the world we're building for the next generation. The real question is how can technology create? More opportunity not for a few. But for all. Addressing the question is called to our mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet. To achieve more. This is not just a set of words for us. But something we care deeply about. Aw success is measured. My other success. Democratizing educational opportunity speaks directly. Do a mission. And it's one of the most pressing societal challenges. Technology can amplify the work of dedicated people and institutions. But rarely can substitute for it. Kantaro toyoma of formal researcher at Microsoft. And the author of the Brooke book geek heresy. Captures it best when he says. That societal change requires more than just technology. Technocrats Esther more reference to them have a tendency to extol the virtues of technology and view it as a remedy. To all the details the system. I'm here today as a heretic. We are under no illusion. The technology alone is the answer to transforming education. Dedicated administrators great teachers motivated students and involved parents and communities are the ones. Changing education. And technologies manglia tool to empower. Dad creativity and their ingenuity. It is this opportunity that motivates our work in education and everything you see today. What are my favorite part of the job? Is to be able to see in learn from the students all around the world? Over the past 2 years I've had a chance to visit students from 20, plus countries. To see students in Jakarta in Tel Aviv use the same office tools that my daughter is used in Seattle. How teachers in Tokyo in Madrid are using Minecraft to teach students computational thinking? How a group of young female students in Cairo? What inspired to learn to code? And built in app to assist the Syrian refugees in their own community. I've been struck. By the commonality's amongst the students. Daring Genuity there first for learning. Diversity in dreams for future. Azob spend time visiting these classrooms, a few things stick out to meet each time. First. Technology should help not hinder teachers work in the classroom. Teachers of constant demands on the time. We must create curriculum grade tests and papers manage classrooms discipline educate inspire. Each time I leave the classroom. The job of a teacher makes my job look easy in comparison. Technology should make teachers lives simpler and spark students creativity not distract from it. This is a top priority that we are focused on at Microsoft. Today, you see how we delivering in Iaccessible streamline platform readily available to all classrooms. So teachers spend less time focus on technology and more time doing what they love doing inspiring students. Secondly, the nature of work is changing drastically. Much of work today happens in teams within groups of people working together to solve the problem. Weather some becomes greater than the parts. We need to prepare all students for this future. And enabled team based learning experiences. In the classroom. Amongst groups of students between students and teachers between teachers and parents. What do you think today is how any classroom can promote learning through collaboration hub for teamwork personalized learning tools and the ability to cope create. By empowering students to learn together their educational opportunities. Get better. Todd we must prepare all students for tomorrow. Consider the report from the World Economic Forum and the jobs report. An estimated 65% of the students entering school today. Will have jobs? The do not yet exist. Teachers know this. I'm there hungry, too, cute, the students for this future. They know that computational thinking and problem solving skills. Archita the future. But they also know that they need to take a much broader view of stand by bringing stem curriculum alongside reading writing design and art. Will set the students up for success in the future? Throughout today's presentation. We will show you new technologies designed to address. These needs and most importantly, how technology can empower students and teachers to enhance the learning outcomes and create a world of tomorrow. Lastly, democratizing educational opportunity must be inclusive of everyone. Not just a select few. To me, this is something that's deeply personal. This includes students with disabilities and different learning styles. They must be given an opportunity to pursue their own dreams. Dyslexia is estimated to impact one in 5 people. 72% of the classrooms of students. With special learning needs. Reading is an essential competency in once a student false far behind. It's difficult to catch up. And it's just not about reading you fall behind in every other subject area. This is something that we aim to address with the OneNote learning tools designed specifically to help students with dyslexia. But it can help. Students. Everywhere with their reading and writing skills. It's been incredible to hear the feedback. From the teachers using this to teach emerging first grade readers or from parents were exhausted their options seeking help for the dyslexic children learning to read. Or how would teacher in Macedonia use the learning tools to teach. Young students English. We will take a look at how these learning tools and much more. Ask Terry Myerson joins me today. To share more of the news. Too close. I want everyone to imagine the world we're building. For tomorrow Justice my grandfathers opportunity change the trajectory of our family. This is what inspires me. How can we collectively come together? Did democratizes the educational opportunity for every student? Both for this generation. And the generations to come. Thank you all very, very much.
